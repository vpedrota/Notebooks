Here we have two files that is an exercise avaliable on: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Psi2QpcCZ6imjuuEEbXjWa62oySUsPpQd--YRbe-BAQ/edit?usp=sharing

On th notebook there are a simple solution wihout verifications and the input requires you to enter using the keyboard.

Both of them find possible solutions to a interval linear algebraic system. the .py one requires that .txt with the matrices follow some pattern and you can see below.
Fist you need to enter the matrix dimensions, so the first line represents the matrix dimensions, line and columns respectively and for the next MxN lines after are the interval for each matrix postion. After the MxN lines, you need to enter the B maytrix, so the next N lines require N intervals. Given a file .txt with that pattern the output will be on output.txt, the pattern for the .txt you can see on the sampple bellow.

Sample:

2 2
2 4
-2 1
-1 2
2 4
-2 2
-2 2
